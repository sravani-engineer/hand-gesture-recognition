# Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe & OpenCV

## Overview
A real-time computer vision system that detects and recognizes hand gestures
using Python, MediaPipe, and OpenCV.

## Problem
Real-time gesture recognition requires low latency and high accuracy
to be usable in human–computer interaction systems.

## Solution
Implemented a real-time gesture recognition pipeline using MediaPipe
for hand landmark detection and OpenCV for visualization and processing.
Optimized the inference pipeline to improve performance.

## Tech Stack
Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy

## Results
- ~90% gesture recognition accuracy
- ~30% faster inference after optimization

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. Run the main Python script
